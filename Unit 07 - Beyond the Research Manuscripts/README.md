### 1. Writing a Review Article
+ **Goals of writing a Review Article**
	+ Synthesize and evaluate the recent primary literature on the topic
	+ Summarize the current state of knowledge on a topic
	+ Address controversies
	+ Provide a comprehensive list of citations
+ **Types of a Review Article**
	+ Non-systematic
		+ Sometimes called a "narrative" review
		+ May not be comprehensive
		+ Qualitative review
	+ Systematic
		+ Attempts to find and summarize _all_ relevant studies on a particular research question. May even include unpublished work.
		+ Follows a rigorous search strategy using pre-defined exclusion and inclusion criteria. Searches multiple databases.
		+ Evaluates the quality of each study using rigorous, pre-defined criteria (often quantitative).
	+ Meta-analysis
		+ A systematic review that additionally uses statistical techniques to pool data from independent studies (sometimes including unpublished studies)
+ **Tips for Review Articles**
	+ Start by searching the literature
		+ Begin with a broader search, to get a sense of what's out there
		+ Then narrow your focus
	+ **_Clearly define your thesis or theme_**
		+ This is the key to a good review article
		+ It can't just be a too broad topic (e.g. I'm going to review computer vision, or breast cancer)
		+ The topic has to be narrow and focused enough to make it tractable (e.g research on the few-shot object detection; the link between smoking and cancer;...)
	+ Invest time getting organized!
		+ Focus on the pre-writing step
		+ You have to find a way to get organized or you will never finish writing the review, there's just too much information
		+ A tip to organize:
			+ Type notes from each paper as you read these papers.
			+ Figured out the sections and subsections of the paper early in the process.
			+ Then, you can organize the notes by section and subsection.
	+ Divide the review into sections with separate headings
	+ Consider putting information in tables, figures, and/or sidebars
	+ Write for a broad audience
		+ People may read your review article as an introduction to the field
		+ Don't abbreviate too much, don't assume prior knowledge
		+ Write in a lively, engaging, and easy to read style
+ **Structure**
	+ Abstract
		+ Write last
	+ Introduction
		+ Clearly state the aim of the review
	+ The body of the paper
		+ Divide into sections
		+ Summarize the literature, organized based on methodology or theme
			+ What we know? What remains unknown?
			+ How studies could do better in the future to fill in the gaps
		+ Analyze, interpret, critique, and synthesize studies	 
	+ Conclusion and future directions:
		+ What recommendations can you make?
		+ What gaps remain in the literature? What future studies would help fill in these gaps?
	+ References

			+ Grammar errors and misspelling
			+ Readability
	10. **Recycle and Resubmit**  
		+ Recycle
			+ Submit to many funding opportunities have similar requirement
			+ Increase the odd for success
			+ Tackinng reviewers' comments from a prior submission
			+ Read the instructions carefully
		+ Resubmit to increase the odd

### 3. Writing for Grants part II - The Specific Aims
+ **Specific Aims**
	+ Executive summary of your entire proposal
		+ Perfect for eliciting feedback!
		+ Critical to developing a first-class proposal
	+ It is a road map!
		+ Should provide the conceptual framework of your proposal
	+ Reviewers will read it!
		+ Empower them all the necessary information to fund your project  
	**_=> One of the most important documents of your proposal_**  
+ **Specific Aims Instructions**
	+ **_Example:_**
		> _"State concisely the **goals** of the proposed research and summarize the **expected outcome(s)**, including the **impact** that the results of the proposed research will exert on the research field(s) involved._
		>
		> _List succinctly the **specific objectives** of the research proposed, e.g., to test a stated hypothesis, create a novel design, solve a specific problem, challenge an existing paradigm or clinical practice, address a critical barrier to progress in the field, or develop new technology._
		>
		> _Specific Aims are limited to ** one page**"._  

	+ Key questions that need to answer:
		+ Is the research question important?
			+ Can it tackle any particular gaps?
			+ Significant advanced on the field
		+ What is the overall goal?
			+ The purpose of the proposal
			+ Fill in the gap delineated by addressing the first question
		+ What specifically will be done?
			+ Your working hypothesis
			+ Your approach to objectively test the hypothesis
		+ What is the expected payoff?
	+ These questions must be specifically aligned, just like gears
		+ You really need to take a big picture look to make sure each of your answers are **_perfectly alligned_** with other answers
	+ Use the answers to the 4 key questions to organize the Specific Aims document!
+ **Structure**
	1) Is the question important?  
		+ Grabbing attention in the first sentence
			+ Highlight your proposal will support the mission of the funding agency
		+ Bring reviewers up to speed
			+ Summarizing the relevant current knowledge
		+ Frame the knowledge gap/need
			+ Important, drive your proposal
			+ The gap or needs statement should identify the critical bottleneck that slowing or stopping progress in your field
	2) What is the overall goal?  
		+ Big-pictural goal (connect with the first section)
			+ Long term goal for your research program
			+ Or a goal that related directly to the funding agencies mission
		+ Objective of this proposal
			+ Narrow the focus 
			+ Describe the objective of the proposal research
				+ Must direcctly address the knowledge gap or the needs statement in the first section
				+ Must be obtainable regardless of how the hypotheses tests

			+ Describe the data that help you formulate your hypothesis
	3) What specifically will be done?  
		+ Aims
		+ Working hypotheses
		+ Methods
	4) What is the expected payoff?

		+ Related to goals of the funding announcement
		+ You can end with a statement
			+ Leaves with the positive impact
	+ **_Example:_**
		+ Standart structure

				+ May vary in length, depending on space limitations and the amount of presented data
				+ Critical review of the relevant literature
				+ Preliminary studies
					+ Establish feasibility of project
				+ The presented data should be clear and able to stand alone outside the greater framework (through figure legend)
			+ Methods
				+ Provide a detailed description of the experimental design
					+ Validation of essential reagents/approaches
					+ Description of controls and their significant
					+ Statistical analysis and interpretation
				+ Remmeber to use strong words (expect, can,...), avoid weaker words (hope, try,...)
			+ Expected Outcomes
				+ Summarize expected experimental outcomes and provide an interpretation of the data
