### 1. What makes a good writing:
+ Communicate an idea CLEARLY and EFFECTIVELY ***(really important)***
+ Elegant and stylist ***(no so important)***

### 2. Examples of what not to do:
+ Verb moves the sentences along, whereas nouns slow them down.
+ Vague words: cannot make the reader get a concrete picture in their head of what the author is talking about. ***=> Don't add anything***
+ Unnecessary jargon and acronyms slow the reading down unless they are standard terms that everybody is familiar with.
+ Passive voice: awkward, hard to read as this is not the way we talk.
+ Distance between the subject and the main verb makes the reader difficult to follow the sentence

### 3. Principles of effective writing
+ Cut unnecessary words and phrases; learn to part with your words!
+ Use the active voice rather than passive voice
+ Use the strong verbs, avoid turning verbs into nouns, and don't bury the main verb! 

### 4. Some common clutter that needs to be cut:
+ Dead words and phrases (As it is well known, as it has been shown, it can be regarded that, it should be emphasized that...)
+ Empty words and phrases (important, methodologic, basic tenets of....)
+ Long words or phrases that could be shorted
+ Unnecessary jargon and acronyms
+ Repeated words or phrases (`studies/examples`, `illustrate/demonstrate`, `challenge/difficulties`, `successful solutions`)
+ Adverbs `(very, really, quite, basically, generally, etc...)` are suitable for speaking  but weak for writing

### 5. Small tricks to cut the clutters
+ **Eliminate negatives.**
  + ***Example***: *She was not often right.*
    + ***She was usually wrong.***

+ **Eliminate there are/is.**
  + ***Example***: *The data confirm that there is an association between vegetables and cancer.*
    + ***The data confirm an association between vegetables and cancer.***

+ **Omit needless prepositions ("that", "on",...)**
  + ***Example***: *They agreed that it was true.*
    + ***They agreed it was true.***

### 6. Practice cutting clutter:
+ _Anti-inflammatory drugs may be protective for the occurrence of Alzheimer’s Disease._
  + ***Anti-inflammatory drugs may protect against Alzheimer's Disease.***

+ _Clinical seizures have been estimated to occur in 0.5% to 2.3% of the neonatal population._
  + ***Clinical seizures occur in 0.5% to 2.3% of newborns.***
  
+ _Ultimately p53 guards not only against malignant transformation but also plays a role in developmental processes as diverse as aging, differentiation, and fertility._
  + ***Besides preventing cancer, P53 also plays role in aging, differentiation, and fertility.***
  
+ _Injuries to the brain and spinal cord have long been known to be among the most devastating and expensive of all injuries to treat medically._
  + ***Brain and spinal cord damage are among the most devastating and expensive.***
  
+ _An IQ test measures an individual’s abilities to perform functions that usually fall in the domains of verbal communication, reasoning, and performance on tasks that represent motor and spatial capabilities._
  + ***IQ test measures an individual's verbal, reasoning, or motor and spatial capabilities.***

+ _As we can see from Figure 2, if the return kinetic energy is less than 3.2 Up, there will be two electron trajectories associated with this kinetic energy._
  + ***Figure 2 shows a return kinetic energy less than 3.2 Up yields two electron trajectories.***
