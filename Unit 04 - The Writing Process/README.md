### More paragraph practice
+ **Practice 1:**
	+ ***Original paragraph***: 
	> "In assessing the quality of an instrument we distinguish three quality domains, i.e. reliability, validity, and responsiveness. Each domain contains one or more measurement properties. The domain reliability contains three measurement properties: internal consistency, reliability, and measurement error. The domain validity also contains three measurement properties: content validity, construct validity, and criterion validity. The domain responsiveness contains only one measurement property, which is also called responsiveness. The term and definition of the domain and measurement property responsiveness are actually the same, but they are distinguished in the taxonomy for reasons of clarity. Some measurement properties contain one or more aspects, that were defined separately: Content validity includes face validity, and construct validity include structural validity, hypotheses testing, and cross-cultural validity."

	+ ***Original outline***:
		+ The information actually is better presented as a table or tree diagram.

	+ ***Edit paragraph***:
	> We assess each instrument based on reliability, validity, and responsiveness. These domains may be subdivided into measurement properties: Reliability includes internal consistency, reliability, and measurement error; validity includes content validity, construct validity, and criterion validity; responsiveness is both a domain and a measurement property. Some measurement properties additionally contain multiple aspects; for example, construct validity includes structural validity, hypotheses testing, and cross-cultural validity.

+ **Practice 2:**
	+ ***Original paragraph***:
	> "The church’s record-keeping system and its high level of accuracy have been previously reported (2). Briefly, the church creates and maintains a church record for each individual who is baptized into the church. These records are created at the congregation level at the time of baptism and then forwarded to the general church level where the membership record is added to the church membership database. These records contain minimal information including name, date of birth, parents’ names, dates of church ordinances, and current address. Each congregation has a lay membership clerk who is responsible for updating the membership records for the members of the congregation. Such updates would include dates of ordinances received after baptism (e.g., priesthood ordination or marriage), name of spouse when a member marries, change of current address and date of death.  
	> While the accuracy of the church record is dependent upon lay clerks within each congregation, each member has an opportunity to review their membership record once a year to check it for accuracy. For this reason and because the church emphasizes accurate record keeping, the information available from the church records is quite reliable, especially for members who are actively involved in the church. When a member dies and the clerk reports his/her death to the Church Membership Council, the membership record is updated and then archived in the church’s deceased membership file."

	+ ***Original outline***:
		+ Main idea: The church's record-keeping system is accurate and reliable.
		+ Point 1: The church congregation create new member record when he/she is baptized
		+ Point 2: There is a lay clerk who updates these records.
		+ Point 3: Member has an opportunity to review their membership once a year
		+ Point 4: When a member dies, the membership record is archived
	+ ***Edit paragraph***:
	> The church's record-keeping system is accurate and reliable (2). When a new member is baptized, the church congregation creates a member record that includes: name, date of birth, parents' names, current address, and dates of church ordinances. A lay clerk enters these records into a general church database and updates them to reflect dates of new ordinances (e.g. marriage), spouse name, changes of address, and date of death. Members may review their membership records once a year, which helps ensure accuracy. When a member dies, their membership record is archived.

+ **Practice 3:**
	+ ***Original paragraph***:
	"Previous studies have consistently reported increased risk of subsequent drug use associated with conduct problems and antisocial behavior in childhood (1-5), and an association of drug dependence with conduct problems was found in a general survey of young adults (9). Furthermore, long-term relationships between aggressive, unconventional, and impulsive behaviors have also been found with drug use involvement generally (10-12). However, different pathways between early childhood misbehavior and drug involvement may exist. Psychiatric symptoms and cognitive disabilities may be manifest as aggressive behaviors and drug use may be a response to impulsive tendencies that often co-occur with aggression or misbehavior. Distress and failure to adopt responsible conventional roles and behaviors may be important mediators linking childhood misbehavior to late drug dependence (13,14)." 
	+ ***Original outline***:
		+ Idea 1: Previous studies have linked early childhood conduct problems with subsequent drug use.
		+ Idea 2: There might be other pathways to explain this link.
	+ ***Edit paragraph 1***: Separate ideas into two paragraphs
	> Previous studies have linked early childhood conduct problems with subsequent drug use (1-5). Studies have also found that young adult (9) and adult (10-12) drug users exhibit more aggressive, unconventional, and impulsive behaviors than their peers.  
	> Several pathways may explain our finding: aggressive children may have underlying psychiatric disorders or cognitive disabilities that increase their risk of drug use; misbehavior tends to co-occur with impulsivity, which increases the risk of drug use; and childhood misbehavior may lead to long-term problems, such as persistent distress or a failure to ever adopt conventional roles or behaviors, which may lead to drug dependence(13,14).

	+ ***Edit paragraph 2***: Remove unrelated material (Adult)
	> Previous studies have linked early childhood conduct problems—including aggressive, unconventional, and impulsive—with subsequent drug use (1-5). Several pathways may explain this link: aggressive children may have underlying psychiatric disorders or cognitive disabilities that increase their risk of drug use; misbehavior tends to co-occur with impulsivity, which increases the risk of drug use; and childhood misbehavior may lead to long-term problems, such as persistent distress or a failure to ever adopt conventional roles or behaviors, which may lead to drug dependence(13,14).

### Notes

+ One exemplary paragraph with wonderful punctuations:
> "Supersymmetry relates each particle of the standard model to another particle called its superpartner; the symmetry is about spin—a standard-model fermion has a bosonic superpartner, and vice versa. By convention, superpartner of fermions gain a prefix 's' (such as selectron, squark and sneutrino), and those related to bosons gain the suffix 'ino'. The prime candidate for dark matter among all of these superparticles is the so-called neutralino — which is a mixture (technically, a mass eigenstate) formed by the superpartners (zino, photino, and higgsino) of standard-model bosons. Other candidates are sneutrinos, and gravitinos, which are related to the gravitaion (although, strictly speaking, gravitinos belong to extended versions of supersymmetric models, known as supergravity models, in which gravity is included)."
