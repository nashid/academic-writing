### 1. Plagiarism
+  **_Example:_**
	+ Michele Obama 2008: **_"You work hard for what you want in life; that your word is your bond and you do what you say you're going to do; that you treat people with dignity and respect..."_**
	+ Melania Trump 2016: _"From a young age, my parents impressed on me the values that **you work hard for what you want in life; that your word is your bond and you do what you say** and keep your promise; that **you treat people with respect."**_
+ **Plagiarism:**
	+ Passing of other people's writing (or tables and figures) as your own.
	+ Includes:
		+ Cutting and pasting sentences or even phrases from another source
		+ slightly rewriting or re-arranging other's words
		+ "borrowing" material from sites like Wikipedia
	+ **_Example:_**
		+ Original Version (Wikipedia): _Ernest Miller Hemingway (July 21, 1899 - July 2, 1961) was an American author and journalist. His economical and understated style had a strong influence on 20th-century fiction, while his life of adventure and his public image influenced later generations._
		+ Plagiarized Version: _Enerst Hemingway's thrifty and understated style strongly influenced 20th-century fiction. His audacious lifestyle and public image also influenced later generations._
+ **Writing about others' ideas/work:**
	+ You must understand the material well enough to put it in your own words!
		+ Probably need to go to multiple sources to adequately understand the subject matter
	+ Remember to put **quotation marks** and **citation** when using sentences or passages from others' works
	+ Work from memory
		+ Never start with someone else's text and just move their words around
		+ You should understand the material well enough
	+ Draw your own conclusions
	+ Do not **mimic the original author's sentence structure** or just **re-arrange** the original author's words
	+ **_Example:_**
		+ Original passage (Klibanski et al. 1995): _"Our data demonstrate that, despite its usefulness in perimenopausal women, estrogen and progestin administration does not reverse the profound osteopenia seen in all young women with anorexia nervosa. Trabecular bone loss is severe and may progress despite estrogen therapy."_
		+ Plagiarized passage (Munoz et al. 2002): _"In conclusion, our data demonstrate that, despite its usefulness in perimenopausal women, estrogen and progestin administration does not reverse the profound osteopenia seen in all young women with AN. Trabecular bone loss is severe and may progress despite estrogen therapy."_
+ **Self-plagiarism and duplication**
	+ Recycling your own writing or data
	+ Including:
		+ Copying or only slightly rewriting text from your own previously published papers
		+ Adding new data to already published data and presenting it as new results.
		+ Submitting identical or overlapping data to multiple journals
	+ **_Example:_**
		+ Original paper (2004): _"Although earlier registry-based analyses of second neoplasms after breast cancer (BC) did not detect and increased risk of cutaneous melanoma (CM), [1][2] several more recent registry-based[3][4] and hospital-based[5] studies have documented a statistically significant increased risk of CM after BC with standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) ranging from 1.4 to 2.7."_
		+ Second paper (2009): _"Recent registry-based [1,2] and hospital-based[3,4] studies have documented a statistically significant increase risk of CM after BC with standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) ranging from 1.4 to 2.7."_
		+ References 1,2,3,4 are identical!

### 2. Authorship
+ Think about authorship before writing a paper
+ **Authorship:** ask 2 questions
	1. Who is going to get authorship?  
		+ Any author listed on the paper's title page should take **public responsibility** for its content.
	2. What the order will be?  
		+ Order implies authors' relative contributions (with exception of the senior author position)
		+ **The first author** is usually the person who wrote up the draft of the paper, collected all the data, ran the experiments, contributed the most
		+ **The last author** is the senior author (head of the lab or research team)
		+ Papers may have dual first authors
		+ For fairness, alphabetical or reverse alphabetical order may be used if researchers have contributed equally (with an informed note about that)
		+ Large working group can be cited as a group
+ **Acknowledgements**
	+ Funding sources
	+ Contributor who did not get authorship (e.g. offered materials, advice, or consultation that was not significant enough to merit authorship)
+ **Ghost authors and guest authorship**
	+ Ghost authors: Professional writers-for-hire who draft manuscripts (usually for companies), nut are not listed as authors
	+ Guest or "honorary" authors: Academic researchers who are minimally involved in a paper, but "lend" their name as an author (often first author!) to bolster the paper's credibility

### 3. The Submission Process
+ **Submission process**
	1. Identify a journal for submission (ideally before writing!)  
		+ What is the appropriate journal
		+ Who is the audience that's going to care about my data
		+ Ask the senior to find the appropriate journal
	2. 	Follow the online "instructions for authors" for writing and formatting the manuscript  
	3. Submit the manuscript online (corresponding author)  
		+ All authors must fill out and sign copyright transfer and conflict of interest forms
	4. Possible outcomes: accepted; accepted pending minor revisions; rejected be re-submission possible; no resubmission possible  
		+ Make sure to read all the reviewers' comments and revise it
			+ Use the feedback to make the manuscript better
	5. Revision and resubmission: re-submit with over letter that addresses reviewers critiques point by point  
	6. Once accepted, **carefully** review final proofs!
+ Reject but resubmission possible
	+ "Your manuscript is not acceptable for publication...However, if you feel that you can suitably address the reviewers' comments, then I invite you to revise and resubmit your manuscript."
+ **Criticism**
	+ Most of us respond to criticisms defensively
		+ You need to get over that defensiveness as fast as you can
		+ Use the reviewers' feedback to improve the paper
	+ However, most reviewers don't always hit the problem on the head
		+ Sometimes they don't quite identify the flaw correctly. But it might lead to some other flaws in the vicinity.
		+ **_Example:_**
			+ Reviewer points out that the analysis is wrong, but it is actually because the analysis is explained poorly and lacked clarification.  
			+ Reviewer points out that the literature review was wrong and mixed up, but it actually because the author had numbered the reference wrong
	+ Look carefully, it might lead you to find something that was wrong and fix it before going to publication.
	+ The faster you see the reviewer critiques as an opportunity to learn and to improve the paper, the easier your life is going to be
+ Resubmission cover Letter/Response to Reviewers.
	> _Dear Dr. Editor_
	>
	> _We appreciate your helpful comments and those of the reviewers. We feel that the manuscript is now greatly improved._
	>
	> _We have made revisions based on the comments/suggestions of Reviewers I and II. The comments of each reviewer are numbered below, with our response (clarifications and changes) following._
	>
	> _Reviewer I:_  
	> 	_1. "There is a little discussion of XXX..."_  
	> 	_We agree with the Reviewers I and II that the section on XXX was abbreviated. Therefore, we have added a paragraph that highlights XXX (paragraph 33)._  
	>
	> 	_2. "Could you comment on YYY..."_   
	> 	_We have added a sentence to paragraph 9 in the Methods section that comments on YYY._

	+ If there is a chance that you disagree with and you think the reviewers got it wrong
		+ Just explain why you are not making that change
		+ Give a thoughtful and respectful response to each specific comment
	+ Also include a copy of the paper with changes tracked
		+ Helps the journal and editor verify exactly where you make these changes
+ _"About 60% of reviewers' criticisms pertain to the quality of the writing or tables and graphs; and about 40% pertain to the quality of the scientific work."_ - Robert Iles. Guidebook to better medical writing
+ **Good writing** and **good data presentation** are the central keys to getting published

### 4. Interview 1

### 5. Interview 2

### 6. Interview 3

### 7. Doing a peer review
+ In the first time you're asked to do a peer review:
	+ You may feel intimidated
	+ You may feel like: "I am too inexperienced. I don't have enough knowledge of the field...."
	+ You should take advantage of that opportunity
		+ You have a chance to see the back end of the publication process **=> great way to learn about the publication process**
		+ Great chance to improve the confidence
+ Journal editors are looking for young reviewers
	+ More up on the latest in the field
	+ Tend to do a more careful job than people who have been doing it for eons
+ The longer people have been reviewing, the more poorly they do in the reviews.
	+ The more you do, the faster you get, the less careful you are
+ **Types of Peer Review**
	+ Single-blind
		+ Most common; authors are blinded to reviewers
	+ Double-blind
		+ Reviewers are additionally blinded to authors
	+ Open
		+ Neither reviewers nor authors are blinded; reviewers names (and reviews) may be publicly available
	+ Post-publication Peer Review
		+ Blog, online comment, etc. More formal systems for post-publication vetting are merging, such as PubMed Commons.
+ **Suggested process for peer review**  
	1. **_Scan the abstract_**    
	2. **_Jump to the data: review the tables and figure first_**  
		+ Draw your own conclusions  
		+ Do the tables and figures stand on their own?  
		+ Are there any obvious statistical errors?
		+ Is there repetitive information?  
	3. **_Read the paper once through_**   
		+ Do the authors' conclusions match their data?  
		+ Is the paper clearly written, or did you struggle to get through it? You should not have to struggle!  
  		+ Is the length of the paper justified given the amount of new information that the data provide?  
	4. **_Read the introduction carefully_**   
		+ Is it sufficiently succinct?  
		+ Does it roughly follow: know => unknown => research question/hypothesis?  
		+ Is there a clear statement of the hypotheses or aim of the study?  
		+ Is there information about _what was done_ that belongs in the Methods?   
		+ Is there information about _what was found_ that belongs in the Results?  
		+ This there distracting information about previous studies or mechanisms that are not directly relevant to the hypothesis being tested?
			+ If so, it should be moved to the discussion  
		+ Do the authors tell you what gaps in the literature they are trying to fill-in?  
	5. **_Read the methods carefully_**    
		+ Scan this section to find answers to your questions about the data
		+ Were things measured objectively or subjectively? What instruments were used?  
		+ Are there flaws in the study design, such as no control group?  
		+ Read the statistics section carefully  
	6. **_Read the results carefully_**   
		+ Read this section with the tables and figures in front of you  
		+ Does each section roughly correspond to one table or figure?  
		+ Do the authors summarize the main trends and themes from the table, or do they just repeat what is in the table?  
		+ If there are graphs, do the authors give precise numerical values in the text if it is not given in the graph?  
		+ Are the authors honest or do they try to draw your eye to what they want you to see?  
		+ Do the authors over-interpret statistical significance, by ignoring the fact that the magnitude is small or by ignoring the fact that they have done multiple subgroup analyses?  
		+ Is this section unnecessarily long?  
	7. **_Look at each table and figure_**  
		+ Did the authors choose the correct statistics?  
		+ Are there multiple tables or figures that tell the same story?  
		+ Is there evidence of cherry-picking or purposefully omitting data?  
		+ Are any graphs misleading, eg, through manipulation of area or axes?  
		+ Is the "treatment" group always compared with a proper control/placebo group?
		+ Are there inconsistencies in the data they present from one table to the next?  
		+ Did the authors make transcribing errors when going from the data in tables/results to the abstract?  
	8. **_Read the discussion carefully_**  
		+ Does the first paragraph succinctly and clearly tell you what was found and what is new?  
		+ Are the authors' conclusions justified or are they overreacting?  
		+ Do they clearly distinguish hypothesis-driven conclusions and exploratory conclusions?  
		+ Is the writing clear and to the point (active voice!)? Is there some sense of order and structure or are they just rambling on aimlessly?  
		+ Could the discussion be shortened?  
		+ Did they address the limitations you care about? (as opposed to any old irrelevant limitations that they threw in just to have some)  
		+ Are the references that they cite current?  
		+ Have they ommitted key references?  
+ **A few tips for peer review**
	+ **_Tone_**
		+ Assume there is some poor graduate student on the other end who did all the work, and whose confidence and career depend on your critique
		+ Just because you're being critical, doesn't mean your tone has to be critical
		+ Tone matters! Be positive!
		+ Avoid criticizing the authors! Criticize the work
			+ **_Example:_** 
				+ _"The author should delete table 5; not only is it completely irrelevant, but it also reveals their utter lack of statistical understanding."_ **=> Hash**
				+ _"Table 4 contains unnecessary information (for example...), and a Pearson's correlation coefficient may not be appropriate here. The authors should consider revising or omitting the table."_ **=> Focusing on the problem rather than criticizing the authors**
		+ Avoid generalizations, point out specific errors.
		+ Use positive instead of negative language where possible: _"The paper is poorly written."_ vs _"The writing and presentation could be improved. For example..."_
		+ Avoid "lecturing" to the authors
	+ **_Comments to authors_**
		1. Start with one-paragraph "general overview"  
			+ State what you think is the major finding and importance of the work
			+ Give 2-3 positive, encouraging statements about the work.
				+ If the methods are problematic, is the writing nice, for example?
				+ Is the research question particularly interesting or novel?
				+ **_Examples:_** _"This is an interesting manuscript, with several strengths."_; _"The author should be commended for..."_; _"The finding that xxx is important."_
				+ It makes the person of the receiving end of the criticism must more receptive, also boost their confidence
			+ State 1-2 major limitations (if any) to the study design, writing/presentation, or conclusions
				+ **_Examples:_** _"The styling is limited because there is no control group."_; _"The overall writing or presentation needs improvement."_; _"The authors may have over-stated their findings."_; _"The paper provides only week evidence for its conclusion."_...	
			+ **Do not** tell the authors your overall recommendation (rejection, acceptance)
		2. In a _numbered_ list, give 5-15 specific criticisms/suggestions for revision. The number will often correspond to your recommendation (give the most if you are recommending "opportunity for revision")
			+ Point out specific mistakes
			+ List the issue that you found in your review
			+ Give specific recommendations for revision
	+ **_Reviewer != Copy editor_**
		+ Do not be spending your time nit-picking
		+ Focus on big-picture issues
		+ If the manuscript has a lot of copy-editing errors, point this out in a general way and give one or two examples, e.g. _"The manuscript contains typos, such as..."_
		+ Journal have the editor to do that (corrects grammar, typos,...)
	+ **_Comments to editors (authors don't see these)_**
		+ Fill out journal "grading sheet" (if applicable)
		+ Chose your recommendation:
			+ Reject
			+ Reject with the opportunity to revise
			+ Accept with minor revisions
			+ Accept
		+ Give a succinct overall statement to the editors that justifies your ranking. Be frank with the editors about your opinion and concerns.
+ **Just review unto the other as you would want to be reviewed. Be kind, be positive.**

### 8. Predatory Journals
+ **Predatory Journals**
	+ Predatory journals are bogus journals that are exploiting the open-access model to make money
	+ The publish any garbage, without any peer review, simply to be able to collect the publishing fee from the authors
+ **Checklist for avoiding predatory journal** (Declan Butler, Nature 2013)
	+ Check that the publisher provides full, verifiable contact information, including address, on the journal site. Be cautious of those that provide only web contact forms.
	+ Check that a journal's editorial board lists recognized experts with full affiliations. Contact some of them and ask about their experience with the journal or publisher.
	+ Check that the journal prominently displays its policy for author fees.
	+ Be wary of e-mail invitations to submit to journals or to become editorial board members.
	+ Read some of the journal's published articles and assess their quality. Contact past authors to ask about their experience.
	+ Check that a journal's peer-review process is clearly described and try to confirm that a claimed impact factor is correct
	+ Find out whether the journal is a member of an industry association that vets its members, such as the [**Directory of Open Access Journals**](doaj.org) or the [**Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association**](oaspa.org)
	+ Use common sense, as you would when shopping online: if something looks fishy, looks like spam, proceed with caution.

### Example of good writing!
> _"The lesson of optogenetics is that the old, the fragile, and the rare——event cells from pond scum or from harsh Saharan salt can be crucial to comprehension of ourselves and our modern world. The story behind this technology underscores the value of protecting rare environmental niches and the importance of supporting true basic science. We should never forget that we do not know where the long march of science is taking us or what will be needed to illuminate our path."_ **— Karl Deiseroth, "Controlling the Brain with Light", 2010**

### Notes
+ Check plagiarism: take a random full sentence from the suspect material and put it to quotes and search it on Google
	+ If Google returns the same sentence in another paper **=> plagiarism**
+ Separate yourself from the critiques, don't take the critiques personally, change your perspective, and view it as an opportunity to improve and learn
+ The first one of doing peer review will take you a really long time
