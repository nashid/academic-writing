# Avoid vague words
* [Thing,” “stuff,” “good,” “bad,” “big“](https://jlvcollegecounseling.com/2018/03/13/20-words-to-avoid-writing-in-your-essay/)

```
The problem with these words is colloquiality and vagueness, inappropriate for academic language. It’s okay to use them in everyday talk; but when in essays, they sound too elementary and make admission officers think of your poor vocabulary. Do your best to master paraphrasing and synonymization for writing more sophisticated words in academic papers.

# [Avoid weak modifiers or redundant](https://jlvcollegecounseling.com/2018/03/13/20-words-to-avoid-writing-in-your-essay/)

```
All they are weak modifiers or redundant –ly adverbs with no meaning. When you need to write a 2,000-word essay, you might fight against the temptation to insert them; but the result will be poor because such words are irrelevant and bring no surplus value to the statements you use in essays. “Very unique,” “really interesting,” and “quite enough” have nothing to do with efficient academic writings.
