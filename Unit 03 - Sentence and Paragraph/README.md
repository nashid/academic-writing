### 1. Punctuation:
+ Increasing power to seperate:
	+ Comma => Colon => Dash => Parentheses => Semicolon => Period
+ Increasing formality:
	+ Dash => Parentheses => Other (Comma, colon,...)

+ Semicolon `;`: 
	- Connects two INDEPENDENT clauses.
	  	- ***Example***: *Kennedy could be a cold and vain main, and he led a life of privilege. But he knew something about the world; he also cared about it.*

	- Separate items in lists that contain internal punctuation.
	  	- ***Example***: *It happened because people organized and voted for better prospects; because leaders enacted smart, forward-looking policies; because people's perspectives opened up, and with them, societies did too.*
		=> **Separate clauses that have internal comma**

+ Parentheses `()`:
	- Insert an afterthought or explanation (a word, phrase, or sentence) that is not essential into a passage that is grammatically complete without it.  ***=> This is also an example.***
	- The sentence's main point should not change if the material within the parentheses is removed. They give the reader permission to skip over the material.
		- ***Example***: *His knowledge of Portuguese is limited to obrigado (thank you) and adeus (goodbye).*

+ Colon `:`:
	- Introduce a list, quote, explanation, conclusion, amplification.
		- ***Examples***: 
			- *The hydrogen bonds are made as follows: purine position 1 to pyrimdine position1; purine position 6 to pyrimdine position 6.* ***=> list***
			- *That's one reason why I'm so optimistic about the future: the constant churn of scientific progress.* ***=> explanation***
			- *The woman suggests from lack of explanation and a chronic Democratic disease: compound sentences.* ***=> amplification***
	- Join two independent clauses if the second amplifies or extends the first. The first clause sets up for the second.
		- ***Example***: 'Companies use Marsh for the same reason that home sellers use real-estate agents: The agent's knowledge and experience is supposed to help the client get the right deal at the right price.''

+ Dash `—` *(-- in LaTex)*:
	- Add emphasis or to insert an abrupt definition or description almost anywhere in the sentence.
	- Just don't overuse it, or it loses its impact
		- ***Examples***:
			- *But my fellow Americans, whatever mix of motives led us to create an Electoral College majority for Donald Trump to become president — and overlook his lack of preparation, his record of indecent personal behavior, his madcap midnight tweeting, his casual lying about issues like “millions” of people casting illegal votes in this election, the purveying of fake news by his national security adviser, his readiness to appoint climate change deniers without even getting a single briefing from the world’s greatest climate scientists in the government he’ll soon lead and his cavalier dismissal of the C.I.A.’s conclusions about Russian hacking of our election — have no doubt about one thing: We as a country have just done something incredibly reckless.*
				- Illustrates **the power of the dash**: Dump so much right into the middle of the sentences, and it still works and reads smoothly ***=> Emphasis the main point.***
				- The colon at the end puts emphasis on the last idea.
				- The main verb is far from the subject. But it's still okay. We can easily find it right after the dash
			- *The drugs did more than prevent new fat accumulation. They also triggered overweight mice to shed significant amounts of fat — up to haft their body weight.* 
				- *Use dash*: ***emphasis.***
		    	- *Use comma instead*: ***loss emphasis, more clunky.***
		    	- *Use parentheses instead*: ***buries the information.***

			- *Researchers who study shipworms say these mislabeled animals — they're clams, not worms — are actually a scientific treasure.* 
		    	- *Use dash*: ***emphasis and add information.***
		    	- *Use commas instead*: ***not strong enough to set off a clause.***
		    	- *Use parentheses instead*: ***buries the information.***

	- *"A dash is a mark of separation stronger than a comma, less formal than a colon, and more relaxed than parentheses."* - The Elements of Style
	- **Note**: You can violate the *"not to put so too much space between subject and the main verb"* if you use dash. You can find the verb.


### 2. Practice, colon and dash:
+ _Evidence-based medicine teaches clinicians the practical application of clinical epidemiology, as needed to address specific problems of specific patients. It guides clinicians on how to find the best evidence relevant to a specific problem, how to assess the quality of that evidence, and perhaps most difficult, how to decide if the evidence applies to a specific patient._
	- ***Evidence-based medicine teaches clinicians the practical application of clinical epidemiology: how to find the best evidence relevant to a specific problem, how to assess the quality of that evidence, and how to decide if the evidence applies to a specific patient.*** *(You can remove "the practical application of clinical epidemiology" along with the colon to make it shorter).*
	
+ _Finally, the lessons of clinical epidemiology are not meant to be limited to academic physician-epidemiologists, who sometimes have more interest in analyzing data than caring for patients.  Clinical epidemiology holds the promise of providing clinicians with the tools necessary to improve the outcomes of their patients._
	- ***Finally, the lessons of clinical epidemiology is not limited to academic physician-epidemiologists — who sometimes have more interest in analyzing data than caring for patients — provides clinicians with the tools to improve their patients' outcomes.***  *(Sometimes use negative construction "not limited" is better than the possitive one "extended". It is more suitable with passive verb.)*


### Parallelism: 
+ Pair of ideals joined by `and`, `or`, or `but` should be written in parallel form.
 	- ***Examples***:
		- *The velocity decrease by 50% but the pressure decreased by 10%.*
		- *We aimed to increase the resolution and to improve picture quality.*
		- *Infinities phrase and infinitive phrase.*

+ Lists of ideas should be written in parallel form. 
	- ***Examples***:
		- *Locusts denuded fields in Utah, torrents washed away rural Iowa, and blazing heat shriveled Arizona's cotton.*
		- *She enjoys running by the lake, playing with her dog, and hiking tall mountains.*

+ How to make a parallelism: Make a choice (grammar structure) and stick to it!
	- ***Example***: *NASA's intrepid Mars rover, Curiosity, has been through a lot in the past year. It flew 354 million miles, blasted through the Mars atmosphere, deployed a supersonic parachute, unfurled a giant sky crane, and touched down gently on the surface of Mars.* ***=> starts with a verb, uses past tense, and deploys nice verbs.***

+ Other examples:
	- *If you want to be a good doctor, you must study hard, critically think about the medical literature, and you should be a good listener.*
		- ***If you want to be a good doctor, you must study hard, listen well, and think critically about medical literature.*** => parallel with verb
	    - ***If you want to be a good doctor, you must be a good student, a good listener, and a critical thinker about the medical.*** => parallel with noun

	- *This research follows four distinct phases: (1) establishing measurement instruments, (2) pattern measurement, (3) developing interventions and (4) the dissemination of successful interventions to other settings and institutions.*
		- ***This research follows four distinct phases: (1) establishing measurement instruments, (2) measuring pattern, (3) developing interventions and (4) disseminating successful interventions to other settings and institutions.***

	- *Bates describes the five principles for the success of decision support systems in clinical settings: speed, real-time delivery, integration into workflow, simplicity and to avoid data entry.*
		- ***Bates describes the five principles for the success of decision support systems in clinical settings: speed, real-time delivery, integration into workflow, simplicity and the avoidance of data entry.***
### 4. Paragraph:
+ 1 paragraph = 1 single idea
+ Paragraph shoud be short => more forcus, provide a lot of white space on the page (less tedious)
+ We should give away the punch line (main point) early
+ Paragraph flow is helped by:
	- logical flow of idea
	- parallel sentence structure
	- Don't rely on transition words. Only use it when necessary.
+ Reader remenbers the *first* and *last* sentence best => make it memorable, emphasis
+ Logical flow of ideas:
	- Sequential in time 
	- General => specific
	- Logical arguments (if `a` then `b`; `a`, therefore `b`)

+ ***Exemplary example***:
	```
	"This kind of progress hasn’t happened on its own. It happened because people organized and voted for better prospects; because leaders enacted smart, forward-looking policies; because people’s perspectives opened up, and with them, societies did too. But this progress also happened because we scienced the heck out of our challenges. Science is how we were able to combat acid rain and the AIDS epidemic. Technology is what allowed us to communicate across oceans and empathize with one another when a wall came down in Berlin or a TV personality came out. Without Norman Borlaug’s wheat, we could not feed the world’s hungry. Without Grace Hopper’s code, we might still be analyzing data with pencil and paper."
	```
	+ Only use 1 transition word ***But***
	+ The main idea is the third sentence - `"But this progress..."` => ***Right in the middle.***
	+ Paragraph flow: ***General to Specific***
	+ Parallel struction: the last four sentences. => ***poetic, move the paragraph along.***


### Notes:
+ Guidances and examples of using punctuation: https://www.thepunctuationguide.com/

+ The rules of three's (lists, examples): **Three*** is the pleasing number to introduce a list
	+ Enough to make a point, but not so much to overwhelm the reader. 
	+ You don't always have to use three, but when in doubt, three is the default.

+ Transition words aren't strong enough to fix underlying logic that's not sound.
+ Professional writer **only** use AND/OR (for tacking on additional information) and BUT/HOWEVER (for changing gear).

+ Paragraphs can flow beautifully without relying on transition words.
+ Parallel structure helps make paragraph flows.
+ Editing paragraph: the outline is needed to think through the logic carefully in head
+ Sometimes, use synonym leads the reader to think you are referring to a different instrument, model, group, variable.
