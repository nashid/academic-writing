### 1. Writing a Review Article
+ **Goals of writing a Review Article**
	+ Synthesize and evaluate the recent primary literature on the topic
	+ Summarize the current state of knowledge on a topic
	+ Address controversies
	+ Provide a comprehensive list of citations
+ **Types of a Review Article**
	+ Non-systematic
		+ Sometimes called a "narrative" review
		+ May not be comprehensive
		+ Qualitative review
	+ Systematic
		+ Attempts to find and summarize _all_ relevant studies on a particular research question. May even include unpublished work.
		+ Follows a rigorous search strategy using pre-defined exclusion and inclusion criteria. Searches multiple databases.
		+ Evaluates the quality of each study using rigorous, pre-defined criteria (often quantitative).
	+ Meta-analysis
		+ A systematic review that additionally uses statistical techniques to pool data from independent studies (sometimes including unpublished studies)
+ **Tips for Review Articles**
	+ Start by searching the literature
		+ Begin with a broader search, to get a sense of what's out there
		+ Then narrow your focus
	+ **_Clearly define your thesis or theme_**
		+ This is the key to a good review article
		+ It can't just be a too broad topic (e.g. I'm going to review computer vision, or breast cancer)
		+ The topic has to be narrow and focused enough to make it tractable (e.g research on the few-shot object detection; the link between smoking and cancer;...)
	+ Invest time getting organized!
		+ Focus on the pre-writing step
		+ You have to find a way to get organized or you will never finish writing the review, there's just too much information
		+ A tip to organize:
			+ Type notes from each paper as you read these papers.
			+ Figured out the sections and subsections of the paper early in the process.
			+ Then, you can organize the notes by section and subsection.
	+ Divide the review into sections with separate headings
	+ Consider putting information in tables, figures, and/or sidebars
	+ Write for a broad audience
		+ People may read your review article as an introduction to the field
		+ Don't abbreviate too much, don't assume prior knowledge
		+ Write in a lively, engaging, and easy to read style
+ **Structure**
	+ Abstract
		+ Write last
	+ Introduction
		+ Clearly state the aim of the review
	+ The body of the paper
		+ Divide into sections
		+ Summarize the literature, organized based on methodology or theme
			+ What we know? What remains unknown?
			+ How studies could do better in the future to fill in the gaps
		+ Analyze, interpret, critique, and synthesize studies	 
	+ Conclusion and future directions:
		+ What recommendations can you make?
		+ What gaps remain in the literature? What future studies would help fill in these gaps?
	+ References

### 2. Writing for Grants part I - Tips for Writing Proposals
+ **Why submit a research proposal**
	+ Clarifies and deepens your thinking
	+ Increases productivity and impact
	+ Critical in all career paths
	+ Securing funding is an accomplishment and has positive career benefits
+ **Tips to start writing for grants**
	1. **_Start Early and gather Critical Information_**   
		+ Compile a comprehensive list of all possible funding opportunities
			+ Ask colleagues, peers and mentors for ideas
			+ Fellowships and career development awards list from institution
		+ Gather critical information
			+ Instructions
			+ Funded & unfunded examples
		+ **_Instruction example:_** [NIH Individual Fellowship(NRSA)](https://researchtraining.nih.gov/programs/fellowships)
			+ Read the funding announcement
				+ Read the entire document and understand what it telling you
				+ Follow the websites attachment and read other documents
				+ Ensure you have all the information available to you
			+ Identify the review criteria
				+ Applicant: research product capability, candidates potential for independent research in future...
				+ Mentor, Co-Mentor, Collaborators: strong track record of mentorship, mentoring plan...
				+ Research Training Plain: research significant, appropriate, feasible,...
				+ Training Potential
				+ Institutional Environment, Commitment
			+ Understand the review process
			+ Learn about internal policies and processes
				+ Submited internally befor the sponsor's deadline?
				+ Extra paperwork?
	2. **Create a Game Plan and Write Regularly**  
		+ Writing a compelling grant takes time, a lot of time
		+ Divide the grant requirements into smaller tasks
			+ Create the task lists
			+ Detail about timeline
			+ Daily or weekly goals or milestones **_=> avoid procrastination_**
		+ Make sure writing regularly (daily or every other day)
			+ Help establish an effective writing practice
			+ Make writing become a habbit
				+ Help increase productivity and reduce anxiety
			+ Make the writing time non-nogotiable => other obligations or distraction don't impede your progress
	3. **Find your Research Niche**  
		+ Deep awareness of your field — identify critical knowledge gaps
		+ Broad familiarity with the wider scientific community
			+ Keep a lost of question or problems inherent to your field
			+ Update this list after reading peer-reviewed papers, review articles, attending seminars or conferences
			+ Narrow down and focus your list through discussion with colleagues, mentors, and key researchers 
		+ Make sure to relevant and appropriate for the mission of the funding opportunity announcement
	4. **Use your Specific Aims document as your Roadmap**  
		+ Detail in [**section 3**](#3-Writing-for-Grants-part-II-The-Specific-Aims)
	5. **Build a First-rate Team of Mentors**   
		+ Leverage the strengths and expertise of collaborators (Team Science)
			+ Helpful to study a complex problem 
		+ Cross-disciplinary to accelerate scientific innovation and translation
			+ Especially important for fellowships and career development awards
	6. **Develop a complete Research Plan**  
		+ Detail in [**section 4**](#4-Writing-for-Grants-part-III-The-Research-Plan)  
	7. **STOP! Get feedback!**  
		+ Feedback is critical to developing a first-class proposal
		+ Need a wide audience providing feedback, as the reviewers will likely come from diverse background
		+ Be proactive in asking for feedback
			+ Colleagues and mentors
			+ Nonscientists can provide critical advice about the clarity
		+ Inform your reviewers of your specific needs (e.g. broader feedback on overall concepts or feasibility? Advice on grammar or writing style?)
	8. **Tell a consistent and cohesive story**  
		+ Grants have numerous documents or sections
			+ E.g. applicant's background and goals, specific aims, research strategy, respective contribution, sponsor, letters of support,...
		+ You must tell a consistent and cohesive story
	9. **Follow specific requirements and proofread for errors and readability**
		+ Strictly follow specific formats and page requirements
		+ Proofread!
			+ Grammar errors and misspelling
			+ Readability
	10. **Recycle and Resubmit**  
		+ Recycle
			+ Submit to many funding opportunities have similar requirement
			+ Increase the odd for success
			+ Tackinng reviewers' comments from a prior submission
			+ Read the instructions carefully
		+ Resubmit to increase the odd

### 3. Writing for Grants part II - The Specific Aims
+ **Specific Aims**
	+ Executive summary of your entire proposal
		+ Perfect for eliciting feedback!
		+ Critical to developing a first-class proposal
	+ It is a road map!
		+ Should provide the conceptual framework of your proposal
	+ Reviewers will read it!
		+ Empower them all the necessary information to fund your project  
	**_=> One of the most important documents of your proposal_**  
+ **Specific Aims Instructions**
	+ **_Example:_**
		> _"State concisely the **goals** of the proposed research and summarize the **expected outcome(s)**, including the **impact** that the results of the proposed research will exert on the research field(s) involved._
		>
		> _List succinctly the **specific objectives** of the research proposed, e.g., to test a stated hypothesis, create a novel design, solve a specific problem, challenge an existing paradigm or clinical practice, address a critical barrier to progress in the field, or develop new technology._
		>
		> _Specific Aims are limited to **one page**"._  
+ **Key questions that need to answer**
	+ _Is the research question important?_
		+ Can it tackle any particular gaps?
		+ Significant advanced on the field
	+ _What is the overall goal?_
		+ The purpose of the proposal
		+ Fill in the gap delineated by addressing the first question
	+ _What specifically will be done?_
		+ Your working hypothesis
		+ Your approach to objectively test the hypothesis
	+ _What is the expected payoff?_
		+ Expected outcomes
		+ Research impact
	![](Images/01.png)  
	+ These questions must be specifically aligned, just like gears
	+ You really need to take a big picture look to make sure each of your answers are **_perfectly alligned_** with other answers
	+ Use the answers to the 4 key questions to organize the Specific Aims document!
+ **Structure**
	1) Is the question important?  
		+ Grabbing attention in the first sentence
			+ Highlight your proposal will support the mission of the funding agency
		+ Bring reviewers up to speed
			+ Summarizing the relevant current knowledge
		+ Frame the knowledge gap/need
			+ Important, drive your proposal
			+ The gap or needs statement should identify the critical bottleneck that slowing or stopping progress in your field
	2) What is the overall goal?  
		+ Big-pictural goal (connect with the first section)
			+ Long term goal for your research program
			+ Or a goal that related directly to the funding agencies mission
		+ Objective of this proposal
			+ Narrow the focus 
			+ Describe the objective of the proposal research
				+ Must direcctly address the knowledge gap or the needs statement in the first section
				+ Must be obtainable regardless of how the hypotheses tests
		+ Best bet/hypothesis
			+ The hypothesis must be objectively testable and should be your prediction or best bet
			+ The hypothesis is the climax of this section (you can **bold** or _italicize_ it)
		+ Supportive preliminary data
			+ Describe the data that help you formulate your hypothesis
	3) What specifically will be done?  
		+ Aims
		+ Working hypotheses
		+ Methods
	4) What is the expected payoff?  
		+ Returns on investment
		+ Related to goals of the funding announcement
		+ You can end with a statement
			+ Leaves with the positive impact
	+ **_Example:_**
		+ Standart structure

		+ Another structure:
			![](Images/03.png)  
+ Remember: **Feedback is critical**
	+ STOP! Get Feedback throughtout the process!

### 4. Writing for Grants part III - The Research Plan
+ **The Research Plan**
	+ The research plan is a narrative document that should provide a clearly defined set of goals and how you plan to reach them
	+ It can be helpful to use a specific aims page as a roadmap
	+ The Research Plan will _"bridge"_ the gap between **the need** (Why the research important?) and **the payoff** (What is the outcome?)
+ **Key question for the Research Plan**
	+ Is there a need?
		+ Significant and background information for the project
		+ Why hasn't it been done already?
		+ Are there any specific barriers that need to be overcome?
	+ How will the project be accomplished?
		+ What methods and analyses will be used?
		+ What are the expected outcomes?
		+ What might go wrong and how will it be managed?
		+ What are the alternative approaches?
	+ How long will the project take?
		+ Is it really feasible in the project time for this proposal?
	+ What is the payoff and what is next?
		+ What are the future directions?
		+ How it is going to advance your field?
+ **Outline for the Research Plan**
	1. **Background/Significance**  
		+ Importance of the problem
		+ Premise for the proposed project, including strengths/weaknesses of pubilished research or preliminary data
		+ Outline the knowledge gap or technical deficiency that the project will overcome
		+ **_Note concerning innovation_**
			+ Approaches
			+ Methodology
			+ Describe how your proposal improves upon previous research or technology
	2. **Aims**  
		+ A hypothesis
		+ Specific aims and objectives used to examine the hypothesis
		+ Description of methods/approaches/techniques to be used
		+ Discussion of possible problems and how they will be managed
		+ Alternative approaches that might be tried
		+ **_Aim organization_**
			+ Introduction
				+ 1 pagragraph
				+ Provide an overview of the aim, including
					+ Specific objective
					+ Working hypothesis
					+ Rationale
					+ Expected outcomes
			+ Preliminary data
				+ May vary in length, depending on space limitations and the amount of presented data
				+ Critical review of the relevant literature
				+ Preliminary studies
					+ Establish feasibility of project
				+ The presented data should be clear and able to stand alone outside the greater framework (through figure legend)
			+ Methods
				+ Provide a detailed description of the experimental design
					+ Validation of essential reagents/approaches
					+ Description of controls and their significant
					+ Statistical analysis and interpretation
				+ Remmeber to use strong words (expect, can,...), avoid weaker words (hope, try,...)
			+ Expected Outcomes
				+ Summarize expected experimental outcomes and provide an interpretation of the data
				+ What is the immediate payoff? Does thos address the knowlege gap you wish to bridge?
			+ Alternative Approaches
				+ Highlight the potential problems 
	3. **Timeline**  
		+ Demonstrates feasibility
		+ You can describe the timeline visually
	4. **Conclusion and Future Directions**  
		+ Summarize expect outcomes, how they will bridge a current knowledge gap, and how the proposed project will lead to progress in the field
		+ Discuss future experiments or approaches
+ **Key questions for the Research Plan**
	[](Images/04.png)  
	+ Your job is to bridge is gaps between the need and the payoff

### 5. Writing Letters of Recommendation
+ **Things to consider**
	+ It's OK to decline if you cannot write a strong letter
	+ Take into account the competitiveness of the position or award
	+ Never ask students to draft their own letters
+ **The candidate should provide**
	+ CV or resume
	+ Information about the position or award
	+ The deadline
	+ Specific information about how to submit the letter
+ **Formatting**
	+ Format it like an old-fashioned letter (date, address of the committee, etc.)
	+ Use letterhead (or the electronic version of that)
	+ Avoid generic greetings such as "to whom it may concern". Rather, address it to a person (if known) or "XX admissions committee" or "XX scholarship committee"
+ **Introduction (first paragraph)**
	+ _"I am pleased/delighted/thrilled to recommend XX for YY."_; _"It's a pleasure to recommend XX for YY."_
	+ How do you know the candidate? How long have you known the candidate?
	+ 1-2 sentence overview
		+ _"He is one of the most brilliant and accomplished students that I have taught to date."_ **_(highest praise)_**
			+ There is a hidden language of the LoR, this is one example
		+ _"I've found her to be a diligent student and researcher. I'm confident that she would be an asset to your research team."_ **_(typical praise)_**
+ **Body of the letter**
	+ Use clear, concise, engaging language!
		+ Using all the good writing techniques
		+ Sometimes the committee wants to interview a candidate just because an engaging and beautifully written letter
	+ The length of the letter matters! _(the hidden language)_
		+ The length of the letter is one indication of the letter writer's enthusiasm for a candidate
		+ If you think a candidate is particularly strong, you always make sure to go on to a second page
		+ If a candidate receives several short one page letters, then perhaps this is the signal to rate the candidate less highly
	+ Address qualities relevant to the position/award, such as:
		+ Quantitative skills
		+ Communication skills
		+ Ability to work with others
		+ Initiative
		+ Ability to prioritize tasks
		+ Creativity
	+ If the candidate is weak in some areas, you need to point this out
		+ But remember, using the positive langue (i.e. _"the person is working on that..."_ or _"has made progress in that area"_)
	+ Give specific memorable examples and stories. **"Show, don't tell"**
		+ _"I sent her request for edits at 10 am in the morning, and she turned around the revision by 3 pm the same day."_
		+ _"Her story stood out. It was funny, witty, and memorable (it's the only one I remember vividly from the class)."_
		+ _"He is also a good citizen and goes out of his way to help others. For example, before he was a TA, he spent several hours a week helping one of our students who was struggling with the fall quarter course in statistics."_
	+ Quantify and compare
		+ Provide some guideposts to the review committee
			+ It helps quantify and compare
		+ _"She is among the top ten percent of MS students I have taught at Stanford."_
	+ Point out extenuating circumstances (if applicable)
		+ _The candidate has had to deal with major family issues or a challenging background_ 
		+ Helpful if a student has a weaker academic record
		+ Reviewer values candidates who have overcome unusual obstacles or who have unconventional backgrounds
	+ Bold/underline/italicize to add emphasis
	+ If possible, quote others (colleagues, students)
		+ _"One of my students wrote this in an unsolicited email:"_
			+ _"You've probably heard already that XX has been a fantastic TA..."_
+ **Concluding paragraph**
	+ Gives your final parting message
	+ _"In sum, XX is a star in all aspects. If there's anything else I can do to support her application, please don't hesitate to contact me."_ **_(highest praise)_**
	+ _"I highly recommend XX for this position. If you have any further questions, I would be happy to expand further on my comments."_ **_(typical praise)_**
+ **Be cautious**
	+ When a letter focuses more on the recommender, class, or project than on the candidate, this is a red flag
		+ This shows the readers that you don't have much to say about the candidate and aren't giving them a particularly high recommendation
	+ It's OK to highlight strengths from the student's CV, but don't simply repeat what's on CV
		+ You can have plenty to write about candidates without even mentioning their awards, honors, experiences
			+ If so, you can come to the end of the letter, listed some of those accolades, and wrote something like this:
			+ _"These are items I would have highlighted at the beginning of any other student's recommendation letter. The fact that I nearly forgot to include this list speaks volumes."_
+ **Language**
	+ Again, there is a hidden language for the LoR
	+ Choose your word carefully
	+ There is a hierarchy of praise. 
		+ **_For example_**  
			_"Though not the top student in the class, he held his own among an extremely gifted and experienced group."_  
				=> He is a good student (positive), but not an outstanding student (negative)  
			**vs**  
			_"He was one of the best students in my class of 50."_  
				=> This is a very solid student, but not the best even in this one class  
			**vs**  
			_"He was the best student in my class of 50."_  
				=> This is an outstanding student, but not the best I've ever encountered  
			**vs**  
			_"He is one of the best students I've had in my career at Stanford."_  
				=> This is the language that you reserve for one student **every few years**. The reviewers look for these kinds of bold statements.  
	+ You have to be honest, and only reserve that language for the truly exceptional candidates.
	+ **_Another example:_**
		+ _"I have confidence in her ability."_  
		**vs**  
		_"I have no doubt that she will go on to do first-rate research."_  
		+ _"She is the most enthusiastic student I've ever worked with."_  
		**vs**  
		_"She is one of the most talented students I've ever worked with."_  
	+ Note:
		+ _"Enthusiastic"_ is a great quality. But an enthusiastic student does not mean he/she is an effective researcher nor a high performer.
		+ If there is a letter where the **highest praise** is that the candidate is _"enthusiastic"_, _"hardworking"_, or a _"team player"_. The reviewers may infer that this means the recommendee is not a top performer.
	+ Be aware of the subtle language of recommendations especially when you are new to writing them
+ **Tips for recommendee**
	+ Be very respectful of your letter writer's time
		+ Approach potential letter writers at least several weeks in advance of the deadline
	+ Choose your recommenders **_carefully_**
		+ Pick people who know you well and who you think have a high opinion of you
	+ Take "no" for an answer, don't be persistent
		+ That can be a subtle hint that they do not feel capable of writing **_a strong letter of recommendation_** for you
	+ Avoid recommenders who ask you to draft your own letter
		+ This person isn't going to take the time writing for you a strong letter
		+ Also, this is **_unfair_** and **_unethical_**
	+ Make life easy for your letter writer, be proactive
		+ Give them information that will help writing the strongest letter possible
			+ Provide them with your CV, SoP,...
		+ Offer to meet with them (office hour)
			+ Make a connection with them, make them remember you
		+ Give them clear and easy instructions on how to submit the letter, also deadline
			+ Provide a link to information about the position or award
			+ Put those at their fingertips
